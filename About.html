<h3>
    Education
</h3>

<p>
I graduated from Vicksburg High School in 2016. The following fall I attended Arizona State University with a focus on business. For my sophomore year, I decided to retrun home and attend Western Michigan University. Early in my junior year, I decided that my course of study and the institution at which I was learning was not right for me. I took some time to figure the right route for me, and ended up  taking a coding Boot Campat Grand Circus in summer of 2020.

Pets
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        I have two pets, a dog named Scarlett, and a cat named Maxx.
        Scarlett is a chocolate lab and she is the bestest girl. 
        Maxx is an orange cat and he is a jerk, but he can be sweet when he wants some scritches.
